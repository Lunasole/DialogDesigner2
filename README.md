This is RAD-tool to compose XML-defined dialogs UI (based on OS backends), then export them as XML or ready-to-use code.

The files uploaded doesn't include everything the binaries have, but are sufficient to build.
The only instruction is that the compiler #IS_FULL constant should be defined additionally to unlock related parts of code (for now it remains from previous versions which I posted mostly as "demo").

Also the code is quite trimmed by tool I'm using for this, nothing to do:) That tool also will be improved further.
At least no so much verbose as original...


LICENSING: for now unspecified, everything is forbidden unless it is permitted explicitly :)
That's because I have no reasons to waste time licensing the code I published.
Still, you can contact me if needed.
